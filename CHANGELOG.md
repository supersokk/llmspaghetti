## [Unreleased]

### Direction / decisions (2026-06-27)
- **Product reframed local-first.** Primary use case = homelab with multiple
  local models, each assigned a role. Cloud APIs are the secondary path. README
  + PROJECT-SCOPE reworded to lead with this.
- **Client strategy decided.** One smart `/v1` endpoint; the router holds ALL
  intelligence; clients (Open WebUI now, VS Code next, our own chat as end-game)
  are thin, swappable consumers. Rule: logic in the router, never client glue.
  See docs/PLANNED-client-strategy.md.
- **Principle added: "Nothing hidden — show your work."** Provenance tag on every
  reply, visible (never silent) fallbacks, inspectable routing log, GPL code.
- **Principle sharpened: "Use what we have, but smarter."** Orchestrate
  Ollama/LiteLLM/Open WebUI; never reinvent them. Own the routing brain only.
- New planning docs: model-management, background-jobs, client-strategy.

### Added (2026-06-27 — first real VM deployment)
- Confirmed full routing chain works end-to-end on Ubuntu 26.04 VM
- Python venv-based install (replaces pip --break-system-packages; required for Ubuntu 26.04 / PEP 668)
- `ENABLE_OLLAMA_API=false` on Open WebUI so every message is forced through the router
- MCP tool injection + tool-call resolution loop in router (from prior session)
- VS Code extension, Settings tab API-key management (from prior session)

### Changed (2026-06-27)
- External OpenAI-compatible API moved from `/api/v1` to `/v1` (avoids clash with Open WebUI's own `/api/`)
- LiteLLM runs with 1 worker (was 2) and no master_key (it's internal-only now)
- First-boot wizard runs on port 3001; Caddy auto-switches to Open WebUI (3000) once healthy
- `local-default` model now follows the user's first model pick (was hardcoded to llama3)
- Documented minimum disk as 50GB (20GB is insufficient for Docker image extraction)

### Fixed (2026-06-27)
- Bootstrap: create /etc/caddy, copy router/eval/config dirs, chown Ollama models dir, create api_keys.env/mcp.json
- Security: litellm_config.yaml now uses env-var references for keys; added to .gitignore
- Stack startup no longer blocks the wizard during `docker compose pull`

### Planned
- Multi-model routing demo (router picks different models per intent)
- Model management UI now that Open WebUI's Ollama API is disabled (see docs/PLANNED-model-management.md)
- Models tab: Load / Stop / Eject / Delete / per-model config panel
- Services tab: tap-to-install ComfyUI, SearXNG, Whisper, Qdrant, n8n, Flowise
- Runtime switcher: llama.cpp, vLLM as optional backends
- Bootable ISO (currently install is git clone + bootstrap.sh only)
- Intel Arc GPU support
- OTA update system
- ARM64 / Raspberry Pi 5 port
